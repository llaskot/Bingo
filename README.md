test issue

Test Case 1: complete
1. Open a browser in full-screen mode. +
2. Go to https://www.pragmaticplay.com/en. +
3. Check if all header menu items (Home, Products, Client Hub, Company, News, Contact) are changing color on mouseover. +
4. Check if "Bingo" option in "Products" menu is changing color on mouseover. +

Test Ð¡ase 2:  complete
1. Open a browser in full-screen mode (or use the browser that it already opened).  +
2. Navigate to https://www.pragmaticplay.com/en  +
3. Select "Bingo" in the "Products" menu.  +
4. Scroll down to the "Our bingo variants" section +
5. Verify that there are 9 Bingo themes. + (Checking only 9 unique themes. I'd prefer to get their correct names)
6. Verify that the elements aren't duplicated. +
7. Verify that the link to the image contains a theme's name (i.e. Rock'n'Swing, Bingo Blast, Boombox, etc.). +
8. Close a browser. +


Expected result:
- The project is hosted in git-repository.  +
- The project is run using maven +
  (you can use BingoConf run configuration to start the test through testng.xml .
  You can use surefire:test to have surefire-report or allure:serve report)

- All tests passed successfully - It is impossible till there are some bugs in the project
- The execution result must not contain unhandled exceptions +

- Java, +
- Maven, +
- JUnit/TestNG, +
- Selenium, +
- PageObject +
- PageFactory, -
- logging, +
- testreport +
- multibrowsers, +
- and other features.
